# Cat-Fish
### Simple browser game, where you steer a cat and eat as many fish as possible before your timer runs out.
<sub>I'm not a professional developer, so yeah.</sub>

## General information
Game right now offers **12 cats** to choose from and **2 different languages** to play in.
Different cats *(excluding the default one)* have different buffs and debuffs.
Those *(de)*buffs can change your <ins>speed</ins> and <ins>size</ins>, but can also change <ins>how much time you have</ins> at the start, or even <ins>how many fish</ins> will spawn.
**Of course**, it wouldn't be a *real 2025* game if it wasn't for ~~*gambling*~~ **taking your chances**.
**_For only 250 coins you can buy a cat in a bag_** *(as there's a saying, that you shouldn't buy a cat in a bag)*
Gameplay is *kinda* repeatable, but as the game is in pretty much early stage of developement, **don't expect too much**.

## Languages used to make the game
- **HTML** <sub>(I know it's not a programming language.)</sub>
- **CSS** <sub>(Kinda obvious)</sub>
- **Vanilla JavaScript** <sub>(I wanted to port all of this into jQuery, but if yk me, **I'm lazy**)</sub>
